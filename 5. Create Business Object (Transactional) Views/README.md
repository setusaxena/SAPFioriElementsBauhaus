# Step 5 : Create Business Object (Transactional) Views

As discussed in Step 3, **Composite interface views** are based on basic interface views and may also have associations to other composite views. They donâ€™t access the database tables directly, but only through the basic view layer.

Composite interface views combine multiple basic interface views or other composite interface views to form new semantic entities. These can be used, for example, as analytical cube views.

## As a part of this step, we shall be creating our Composie Interface Core Data Services (CDS) Views

### Transactional views to Be Created:
- **zfe_r_employee_xx**: <a href="./Data Definition zfe_r_employee_xx" target="_blank">:link:</a> **Emp Services Summary** Employee Transactional View for FE Demo.
- **zfe_r_empservices_xx**: <a href="./Data Definition zfe_r_empservices_xx" target="_blank">:link:</a> **Emp Services Summary** Employee Services Transactional View for FE Demo.
