# Step 10. Create Access Control

**DCL** stands for Data Control Language. **DCL** is used to define and manage access controls and authorizations for CDS views. It specifies which users or roles have access to the data exposed by a CDS view and what type of operations they can perform on this data.


## Perform the following steps to implement a Access Control:

1. Create a Authorization Field and Authorization Object.
2. Create a Access Control in Eclipse for the desired CDS view.
3. Create a PFCG role and assign it to the user with authorizations.
4. Create a Fiori App to preview the output (Optional as the output can be viewed in the CDS level itself)

### Access control to be created:

-  **zfe_c_employee_xx**:  [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/setusaxena/SAPFioriElements/blob/main/10.%20Adding%20Access%20Control/Create%20access%20control%20to%20zfe_c_employee_xx)
