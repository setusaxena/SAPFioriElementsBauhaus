# Step 4 : Composie Interface Core Data Services (CDS) Views

As discussed in Step 3, **Composite interface views** are based on basic interface views and may also have associations to other composite views. They donâ€™t access the database tables directly, but only through the basic view layer.

Composite interface views combine multiple basic interface views or other composite interface views to form new semantic entities. These can be used, for example, as analytical cube views.

## As a part of this step, we shall be creating our Composie Interface Core Data Services (CDS) Views
